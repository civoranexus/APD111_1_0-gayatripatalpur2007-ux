Day 7 Project Activity – CropGuard AI Disease Detection System
1) Objective of the Day

To enhance disease classification accuracy using image-based analysis.

To evaluate system performance across different crop disease categories.

2) User Role

Farmer: Uploads crop images to receive disease detection results.

System User: Reviews disease type, confidence level, and analysis output.

3) Core Modules Learned

Disease classification and prediction logic.

Confidence score refinement for AI outputs.

Image quality handling and preprocessing concepts.

Result visualization and interpretation.

Understanding limitations of AI-based disease detection.

4) Outcome of the Day

Improved understanding of multi-disease classification.

Observed the impact of lighting and image quality on detection accuracy.

Enhanced clarity and reliability of AI-generated results.

Strengthened overall disease detection workflow.

5) Future Scope

Addition of crop-specific disease datasets.

Integration of treatment and prevention suggestions.

Mobile-based image capture for real-time detection.

Continuous learning using farmer-uploaded data.

Deployment of the system as a farmer-friendly application.
