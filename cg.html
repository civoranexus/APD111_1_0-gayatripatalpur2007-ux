Day 16 Project Activity – CropGuard AI Disease Detection System
1) Objective of the Day

To improve system reliability through structured testing.

To identify edge cases and unusual scenarios in disease detection.

2) User Role

Farmer: Uploads different crop images under varied conditions.

System User: Observes system behavior and verifies detection outcomes.

3) Core Modules Learned

Functional testing of AI-based systems.

Identifying edge cases in image-based detection.

Handling unexpected or incomplete inputs.

Validating consistency across repeated tests.

Debugging and refinement strategies.

4) Outcome of the Day

Identified edge cases affecting detection accuracy.

Improved handling of unusual or unclear images.

Strengthened system stability and consistency.

Enhanced understanding of testing strategies for AI applications.

5) Future Scope

Automate test case generation.

Implement stress testing for large image uploads.

Use testing feedback to refine AI models.

Prepare the system for real-world deployment scenarios.
