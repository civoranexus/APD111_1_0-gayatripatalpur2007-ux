🌾 Second Last Day Project Activity – CropGuard AI Disease Detection System (Day 19)
🔹 Objective of the Day

To perform final system integration of all modules

To ensure smooth working of the complete workflow

To prepare the project for final submission and presentation

🔹 User Roles

Farmer:

Uploads crop image

Receives disease result, severity level, confidence score, and advisory guidance

Admin/System User:

Tests overall system performance and verifies output correctness

🔹 Key Work Completed

Combined all modules into one complete system:
✔ Image upload
✔ Image preview
✔ Disease detection output
✔ Severity level indicator
✔ Confidence score display
✔ Advisory recommendation section
✔ Error handling & validation

Tested full system flow using multiple sample crop images

🔹 Core Modules Learned

Full project integration techniques

Debugging and issue fixing in combined modules

End-to-end testing approach

Improving system flow and user experience

🔹 Outcome of the Day

CropGuard AI became a complete functional prototype

System outputs became more accurate, clear, and farmer-friendly

Project reached final ready stage for presentation

🔹 Future Scope

Add real AI model integration using TensorFlow / CNN

Build mobile app version for farmers

Add multilingual support (Marathi/Hindi)
