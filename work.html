To analyze crop disease symptoms using image-based inputs.

To understand how AI can support early disease identification for farmers.

2) User Role

Farmer: Uploads crop images to detect possible diseases.

System User: Reviews disease detection results for decision-making.

3) Core Modules Learned

Image upload and preview module.
Visual symptom analysis for crop diseases.

Disease classification logic.

Output display and result interpretation.

Handling real-world agricultural image challenges.

4) Outcome of the Day

Understood common visual indicators of crop diseases.

Gained insight into AI-driven disease detection workflows.

Identified practical challenges faced by farmers in disease diagnosis
Built a strong foundation for further model improvement.

5) Future Scope

Integration of real-time disease detection using mobile cameras.

Expansion of the system to support multiple crop types.

Improvement in detection accuracy using advanced AI models.
