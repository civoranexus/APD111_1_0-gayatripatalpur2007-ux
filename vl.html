🌾 Day 18 Project Activity – CropGuard AI Disease Detection System
🔹 Objective of the Day

To introduce image quality validation before disease detection

To reduce incorrect or low-confidence predictions

To guide farmers to upload clear and usable images

🔹 User Roles

Farmer:

Uploads crop image

Receives feedback if the image quality is insufficient

System User:

Ensures only valid images are processed for detection

🔹 Key Enhancements Implemented

Added pre-scan image quality checks

Detection of:

Blurry images

Low-light images

Unsupported image formats

Displayed friendly instructions to re-upload better images

🔹 Core Modules Learned

Image validation techniques

Preprocessing logic for AI systems

Error handling and user guidance

Improving model reliability through input quality

🔹 Outcome of the Day

Improved accuracy of disease detection

Reduced false results due to poor image input

Better user guidance and smoother workflow

🔹 Future Scope

Auto image enhancement (brightness/contrast)

Real-time camera capture guidance

Quality score indicator for uploaded images
