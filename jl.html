Day 14 Project Activity – CropGuard AI Disease Detection System
1) Objective of the Day

To improve the accuracy and reliability of disease detection results

To understand how AI confidence scores help users trust predictions

2) User Role

Farmer: Uploads crop images and checks disease confidence level

System User: Verifies detection results and confidence insights

3) Core Modules Learned

Image-based disease classification concept

Confidence score generation and interpretation

Handling uncertain or low-confidence predictions

Basic AI decision-support logic

Error handling for unclear or poor-quality images

4) Outcome of the Day

More informative and transparent disease detection results

Users can understand how confident the system is about predictions

Reduced confusion in borderline or unclear cases

5) Future Scope

Improve AI model accuracy with more training data

Add comparison with previous scans

Introduce explanation-based AI outputs for farmers
